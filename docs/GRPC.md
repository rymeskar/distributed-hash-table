# GRPC
Protobuf files are best added manually in csproj.
# Autogenerated Service
Do not care about InteliSense mentioning errors. 
The base classes will get auto-generated on usage.
# Register New Endpoint
`endpoints.MapGrpcService<GreeterService>();` in Startup.
# Automatic Generation of included files does not work
`import 'bla.proto'`
# Missing interface + investigate DI!
