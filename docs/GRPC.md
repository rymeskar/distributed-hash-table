# GRPC

## Protobuf
Protobuf files are best added manually in csproj (can decide what exactly gets generated+Include as Link).
## Autogenerated Service
Do not care about InteliSense mentioning errors. 
The base classes will get auto-generated on usage anyways.
## Register New Endpoint
`endpoints.MapGrpcService<GreeterService>();` in Startup, otherwise APIs are not exposed.
## Automatic Generation of included files does not work
`import 'bla.proto'` in protocol buffer definitions does not work :(. Report bug!

## Missing interface + investigate DI
The types are hard to mock. Also, setup is not really that DI-friendly. Should report a bug/design discussion point with AspNet.Core team.
